# MY472_Assignment1
This repository was created for the first assignment for LSE course 'MY472 Data for Data Scientists'. The course information could be found [here](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2022-2023/courseGuides/MY/2022_MY472.htm). 
And the assignment problem set could be found [here](https://lse-my472.github.io/assignments/formative.html). 

- `assignment1.html` presents the final output and interpretations of all problems.
- `assignment1.Rmd` is an RMarkdown file and contains several code chunks for each exercise.  

Note: this is a formative assessment which does not count towards the final grade, only for coding practice and format checking.
